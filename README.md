# Scatter Plot 
## Overview
in this project i used python and included the libraries: pandas, Matplotlib, as well as Seaborn to create a visual analysis on the Gender Dataset, for this project the created fucntion is scatter plot and it is a very simple tool to showcase the distribution of income for both males and females based on thier age.
## Data 
the source of the dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadtalharasool/simple-gender-classification

## Technologies Used
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

##Walk Through
1. Importing the data  
starting with reading the .csv file, recognising the columns to be used and checking for any  missing values  

2. creating the function  
After having the data in pandas DataFrame using matplotlib.pyplot's scatter() function. The function takes two arguments: the x-axis values and the y-axis values. it can be customized the appearance of the plot by passing in additional arguments
